      AFK stands for "<i>away from keyboard</i>".
      It is basically Internet slang to say that you are away.

      <b>/afk <i>(reason)</i> —</b> Define yourself as away.
      <b>brb <i>(reason)</i> —</b> Does the same as the afk command but without having to use the <code>/</code>.

      When you are set as afk, any mention of you will be answered with a message that you are away!
